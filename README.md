## React for Google map api.

Got a requirement to use React and google maps to display traffic, bike and transit layers using the google api. Did a quick research on available custom library (listed below) but couldn't find any to achieve the same.

* google-maps-react
* react-google-maps
* react-google-maps-api

Then gave a try to use JS API so that I could extend the solution whatever way I want and after that I won't be dependent on Custom libraries.
